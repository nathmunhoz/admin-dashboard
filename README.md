# Admin Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

This project is a modern, responsive administrative dashboard designed to provide users with a comprehensive overview of key data and system status. It features a clean, highly functional layout optimized for efficient data monitoring and task management.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to create a robust and aesthetically balanced single-page application structure using standard web technologies.

## Features

The dashboard provides structured access to all core system functions:

* **Header Navigation:** Includes a global search bar, user profile access, notification system, and primary action buttons (New, Upload, Share).
* **Sidebar Navigation:** A persistent navigation menu for quickly switching between main modules (Home, Profile, Messages, Tasks, Settings, etc.).
* **Data Layout:** The main content area is split into two primary columns:
    * **Projects (Dominant Column):** Displays a flexible grid of primary tasks or data sets, featuring large, engaging cards.
    * **Announcements & Trending (Secondary Column):** Provides a narrower space for recent system updates, notifications, and highlight active users or topics.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout utilizes CSS Grid and Flexbox to maintain coherence and balance across different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

This dashboard is built exclusively with foundational web technologies, demonstrating proficiency in modern layout techniques:

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and organization.
* **CSS3:** Styling and layout, specifically using:
    * **CSS Grid:** For the main `sidebar`/`header`/`main` layout and the `projects` grid.
    * **Flexbox:** For alignment within components (e.g., the header, card footers, and trending profiles).
* **SVG Icons:** Ensures all graphical elements are scalable and crisp.
